Welcome to the Bf Interpreter and Compiler implemented in Scala!
December 2023

## Overview

This Scala project provides both an interpreter and a compiler for the Brainf**k programming language. Bf is an esoteric programming language known for its minimalistic design, consisting of a small set of commands.

## Features

1. **Bf Interpreter:**
   - Executes Brainf**k programs directly using an interpreter.

2. **Bf Compiler:**
   - Compiles Brainf**k programs into an intermediate representation for execution.

## Bf Language

- Brainfuck consists of a simple set of commands, each represented by a single character.
- The commands include `>`, `<`, `+`, `-`, `[`, `]`, `.`, and `,`.
- The language operates on a memory tape with cells, and the commands manipulate the tape and its contents.
